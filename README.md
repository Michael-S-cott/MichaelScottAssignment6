The white strip in some of the corners is due to imprecise cropping/placement of the goat image. It worked properly with the original texture.

It is a bit hard to see, but there is a ceiling.

The "art" is all 1x1, which in retrospect is a bit small, but I hope that's not too much of a problem.

I cropepd the goat image because it had an unintended background, but the white square art is supposed to be a white square against
a white background (I think, because it has a shadow on it), so I decided to not crop out the white background for that.
